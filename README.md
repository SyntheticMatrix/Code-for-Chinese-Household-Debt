**IMPORTANCE**
The EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS can be done by running the main_file.m, which will automatically run the data sorting, SVAR model, and cross-correlation test. The ADF test can be done by the matlab function adftest. The DAR and DIR are calculated via STATA files. The two are not included in our main_file.m
